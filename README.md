# way11

Run Wayland-only apps on X11.

### How?

Weston (a Wayland compositor) can run in a windowed form, which allows us to run apps like they're natively running on X11.

### Why?

There are many apps for Linux now that are Wayland-only, and as an (ancient) NVIDIA card user, these apps simply don't work for me.

### Tested apps

| App name | Works? |
